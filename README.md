##About me
I am a the world's greatest criminal programmer. My evil genius is dedicated to making the world safe for cartoon villans.

As a child I watched cartoons, and always felt bad for the bad guys. Why are they always protrayed as evil? Who gets to define "evil"?

Through my masterful manipulation of social media, I intend to make Snidley Wiplash a hero to billions of people world wide.
